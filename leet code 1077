#SOLUTION 1:
# left join project table on employee table
# rank on each employee's experience, group by project_id --> use window function to rank (dense rank)
# then select the target


SELECT project_id, employee_id FROM 

(
SELECT Project.project_id, Project.employee_id, Employee.experience_years,

dense_rank() over (partition by Project.project_id order by Employee.experience_years desc ) as rank1

LEFT JOIN Employee

ON Project.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
    
    ) A

#SOLUTION 2: USE CTE
