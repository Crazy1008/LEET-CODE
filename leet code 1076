#solution 1 can work, but it cannot print out all result which have same count number.
#therefore, better to rank the total employee number then print the result.


SELECT project_id

FROM Project

group by project_id

order by count(employee_id) desc

limit 1

#solution 2 work:

SELECT b.project_id 

FROM (

SELECT a.project_id, total1,

dense_rank() over (order by total1 desc) as rank1

FROM (

SELECT project_id, count(employee_id) as total1

FROM Project

group by project_id
    
    ) A
    ) B
    
WHERE rank1 = 1
