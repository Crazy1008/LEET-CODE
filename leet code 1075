#difference between solution 1 & 2: window function on sum can be subsituted by sum & group by

#solution 1:

SELECT distinct a.project_id, round((total_year/count1),2) as average_years

FROM (

SELECT Project.Project_id, sum(Employee.experience_years) over(partition by project.project_id) as total_year,

count(Employee.employee_id) over(partition by project.project_id) as count1


FROM Project 

LEFT JOIN  Employee

ON Project.employee_id = Employee.employee_id

) A



#solution 2:

# left join to employee on project to combine
# sum total years of each project_id --> sum then group by
# cal the average of them

SELECT distinct a.project_id, round((total_year/count1),2) as average_years

FROM (

SELECT Project.Project_id, sum(Employee.experience_years)  as total_year,

count(Employee.employee_id)  as count1


FROM Project 

LEFT JOIN  Employee

ON Project.employee_id = Employee.employee_id
    
group by Project.Project_id
