# for method 1 & 2:
# SALES table left join Product
# select buyer who bought ipthone as subquery using in WHEN condition
# select buyer who bought S8 and not in the list who buy ipthone


# method 1 is not working: the second condition under WHERE is not working because before adding the second condition, the result is : 1, S8 / 3, S8, the filter I
#          added is not working on the result.
# ALWAYS REMEMBER DISTINCT !!!!!!!
